# **12. Security Considerations**

**Essential Security Measures:**

1.  **Environment Variables:** The `.env` file must never be committed to version control.
2.  **Session Secret:** Use a long, random string (32+ characters) for the session secret.
3.  **Token Storage:** User access tokens must only be stored and used on the backend, never exposed to the frontend.
4.  **Input Validation:** Sanitize all user input, especially the channel selections (e.g., limit to 10).
5.  **HTTPS Only:** The production deployment must enforce HTTPS.
6.  **CORS:** The Express server should be configured to only allow requests from the frontend domain.

## **Next Steps**

The planning phase is complete. This PRD and Architecture document provide the full blueprint for the MVP. The next step is to begin development, starting with Story 1.1 from the PRD.
