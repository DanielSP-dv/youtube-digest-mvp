# **19. Monitoring and Observability**

For the MVP, our monitoring strategy will leverage the built-in capabilities of our chosen platforms, focusing on essential metrics to ensure application health and performance.

### **Monitoring Stack**

*   **Frontend Monitoring:** Vercel Analytics (built-in) for page views, unique visitors, and basic performance metrics. Browser developer tools for local debugging.
*   **Backend Monitoring:** Vercel's built-in serverless function logs and execution metrics.
*   **Error Tracking:** Console logging for immediate errors during development. For production, Vercel's logs will capture backend errors.
*   **Performance Monitoring:** Vercel Analytics for frontend performance (Core Web Vitals). Backend performance will be observed through Vercel's function execution times.

### **Key Metrics**

We will focus on a core set of metrics to assess the application's health and user experience.

*   **Frontend Metrics:**
    *   **Core Web Vitals:** (Largest Contentful Paint, Cumulative Layout Shift, First Input Delay) to measure user experience.
    *   **JavaScript Errors:** Number of client-side errors.
    *   **API Response Times:** Latency of frontend calls to our backend.
    *   **User Interactions:** Basic analytics on feature usage (e.g., digest sent, video saved).
*   **Backend Metrics:**
    *   **Request Rate:** Number of API calls per minute/hour.
    *   **Error Rate:** Percentage of API calls resulting in errors.
    *   **Response Time:** Latency of backend API calls.
    *   **Database Query Performance:** Latency of database operations (observable via Prisma logs or Supabase dashboard).
    *   **External API Call Success/Failure Rates:** (YouTube, LLM, Email Service).
