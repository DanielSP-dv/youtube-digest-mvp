# **15. Security and Performance**

This section outlines the key security measures and performance optimization strategies for our application, ensuring it is robust, responsive, and protected.

### **Security Requirements**

We will implement security best practices across the frontend and backend, leveraging our chosen technologies.

*   **Frontend Security:**
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) Headers:** Implement strict CSP headers to mitigate cross-site scripting (XSS) and other injection attacks.
    *   **XSS Prevention:** React and Next.js provide built-in protections against XSS by escaping rendered content. Further sanitization will be applied for user-generated content.
    *   **Secure Storage:** Sensitive user data (e.g., access tokens) will be stored securely using NextAuth.js's recommended methods (e.g., HTTP-only cookies).
*   **Backend Security:**
    *   **Input Validation:** All incoming data to API routes will be rigorously validated using Zod schemas (integrated with tRPC) to prevent malicious inputs and ensure data integrity.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on critical endpoints (e.g., authentication, LLM calls) to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
    *   **CORS Policy:** Next.js API routes inherently handle CORS for same-origin requests. For any cross-origin needs (if they arise), a strict CORS policy will be configured.
*   **Authentication Security:**
    *   **Token Storage:** NextAuth.js handles the secure storage of session tokens (e.g., in encrypted, HTTP-only cookies).
    *   **Session Management:** NextAuth.js provides robust session management, including session expiration and invalidation.
    *   **Password Policy:** (Not applicable as we use Google OAuth, no direct password management).

### **Performance Optimization**

We will leverage Next.js's features and best practices to ensure a fast and responsive user experience.

*   **Frontend Performance:**
    *   **Bundle Size Optimization:** Next.js automatically optimizes JavaScript bundles, including code splitting and tree-shaking.
    *   **Loading Strategy:** Implement lazy loading for components and images to reduce initial page load times.
    *   **Image Optimization:** Use Next.js's `Image` component for automatic image optimization and responsive serving.
    *   **Caching Strategy:** Leverage browser caching for static assets and API responses where appropriate.
*   **Backend Performance:**
    *   **Efficient Database Queries:** Use Prisma to write optimized and efficient database queries, including proper indexing.
    *   **Serverless Scaling:** Vercel's serverless functions automatically scale based on demand, ensuring high availability and responsiveness.
    *   **Caching Strategy:** Implement caching for frequently accessed data (e.g., channel metadata, video summaries) to reduce database load and API call costs.
