# **10. Coding Standards**

**Code Style:**

*   **JavaScript Standard:** Use consistent formatting (2 spaces for indentation).
*   **No Semicolons:** Follow modern JS convention of omitting semicolons.
*   **Async/Await:** Prefer async/await over callbacks for cleaner code.
*   **Error Handling:** Every async function must have try/catch blocks.

**Naming Conventions:**

*   Variables and functions: `camelCase`
*   Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`
*   React components: `PascalCase`
*   Files: `lowercase-with-dashes` or `camelCase`

**Comment Requirements:**

*   Every non-obvious function needs a comment explaining its purpose.
