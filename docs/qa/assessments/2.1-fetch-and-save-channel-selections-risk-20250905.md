# Risk Profile: Story 2.1

**Date:** 2025-09-05
**Reviewer:** Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- **Total Risks Identified:** 4
- **Critical Risks (Score 9):** 0
- **High Risks (Score 6-8):** 1
- **Medium Risks (Score 4-5):** 1
- **Low Risks (Score 1-3):** 2
- **Overall Risk Score:** 68/100 (Medium Risk)

This story has a **Medium** overall risk profile. The primary risk is the critical dependency on the external YouTube API. Development should focus on robust error handling, caching, and secure token management.

## Detailed Risk Register

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### 1. TECH-001: External API Dependency

*   **Score:** 6 (High)
*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Corrective & Detective
*   **Actions:**
    *   Implement comprehensive error handling for all YouTube API calls.
    *   Provide clear, user-friendly feedback in the UI when the API fails or is slow.
    *   Cache the subscription list on the backend for a reasonable duration (e.g., 1 hour) to reduce API calls.
*   **Testing Requirements:**
    *   Integration tests should mock YouTube API failure scenarios (e.g., 500 errors, rate limit errors).
    *   Manual testing should verify that the UI displays a proper loading state and handles errors gracefully.

### 2. PERF-001: Slow API Response for Subscriptions

*   **Score:** 4 (Medium)
*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Preventive
*   **Actions:**
    *   Implement a clear loading indicator on the frontend while subscriptions are being fetched.
    *   Investigate pagination for the `subscriptions.list` API call to fetch channels in chunks.
*   **Testing Requirements:**
    *   Manual testing with a test account that has a large number of subscriptions (>200) to assess real-world performance.

### 3. SEC-001: Insecure Handling of OAuth Tokens

*   **Score:** 3 (Low)
*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Preventive
*   **Actions:**
    *   Confirm that the user's `access_token` is stored securely on the backend and is never sent to the client in any API response.
    *   All API calls using the token must originate from the backend server.
*   **Testing Requirements:**
    *   Code review to ensure no leakage of tokens to the frontend.
    - Manually inspect network traffic in browser dev tools to confirm tokens are not present in API responses.

### 4. DATA-001: Data Integrity on Channel Selections

*   **Score:** 2 (Low)
*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Preventive
*   **Actions:**
    *   The backend logic for updating channel selections (delete then insert) must be wrapped in a database transaction to ensure atomicity.
*   **Testing Requirements:**
    *   An integration test should be created to simulate a failure during the insert step, verifying that the original data is rolled back correctly.

## Monitoring Requirements

*   **YouTube API:** Monitor the latency and error rate of calls to the `subscriptions.list` endpoint.
*   **Backend API:** Monitor the performance of the `/api/subscriptions` and `/api/channels` endpoints.
