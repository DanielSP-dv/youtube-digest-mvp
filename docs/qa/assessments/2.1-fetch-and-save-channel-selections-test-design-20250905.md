# Test Design: Story 2.1

**Date:** 2025-09-05
**Designer:** Quinn (Test Architect)

## Test Strategy Overview

This test design outlines the manual verification steps required to ensure Story 2.1 is implemented correctly. The focus is on end-to-end functionality, data integrity, and handling of external dependencies.

- **Total test scenarios:** 8
- **Priority distribution:** P0: 4, P1: 4

## Test Scenarios by Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Fetch User's Subscriptions

| ID | Level | Priority | Test Scenario | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2.1-MAN-001 | Manual | P0 | **Happy Path:** Log in and navigate to the `/channels` page. Verify that a list of YouTube channels is displayed. | Validates the core functionality of fetching and displaying subscriptions. |
| 2.1-MAN-002 | Manual | P1 | **API Failure:** Simulate a failure from the `/api/subscriptions` endpoint. Verify that a user-friendly error message is displayed on the page. | Covers `TECH-001` risk. Ensures graceful failure. |

### AC2 & AC3: Display and Limit Selections

| ID | Level | Priority | Test Scenario | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2.1-MAN-003 | Manual | P1 | **UI Interaction:** Verify that channels are displayed with checkboxes and that a maximum of 10 channels can be selected at once. | Validates the frontend logic for selection and limitation. |

### AC4 & AC5: Save Selections

| ID | Level | Priority | Test Scenario | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2.1-MAN-004 | Manual | P0 | **Happy Path:** Select 5 channels and click "Save". Refresh the page and verify the same 5 channels are still selected. | Validates the end-to-end save functionality. |
| 2.1-MAN-005 | Manual | P0 | **Data Replacement:** Select 3 different channels and click "Save". Refresh and verify that only the 3 new channels are selected, and the previous 5 are not. | Ensures the backend correctly replaces the old selection. |
| 2.1-MAN-006 | Manual | P0 | **Data Integrity:** (Requires backend access) Simulate a database error during the save process. Verify that the user's original selections (if any) are not lost. | Covers `DATA-001` risk. Ensures transactional integrity. |

### AC6: Pre-fill Saved Selections

| ID | Level | Priority | Test Scenario | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2.1-MAN-007 | Manual | P1 | **Verification:** Log out and log back in. Navigate to the `/channels` page and verify that the previously saved selections are correctly pre-filled. | Confirms that saved data persists across sessions. |

## Risk Coverage

| Risk ID  | Mitigating Test Scenarios |
| :--- | :--- |
| TECH-001 | 2.1-MAN-002 |
| PERF-001 | Manual testing with a high-subscription account is recommended. |
| SEC-001  | Manual code review and network inspection required. |
| DATA-001 | 2.1-MAN-006 |

## Recommended Execution Order

1.  Execute all P0 scenarios first to validate core data flow.
2.  Execute P1 scenarios to validate UI and edge cases.
