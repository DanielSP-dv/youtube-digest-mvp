# Story 2.3: Generate and Cache Summaries

## Status: Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to generate an AI summary for each new video and cache it in the database,
**so that** we can display it to the user and minimize API costs.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1.  After a new video record is created (from Story 2.2), the system sends its transcript to the OpenAI API.
2.  The prompt limits the context size and requests a short summary to manage cost, as per the defined strategy.
3.  The returned summary is saved to the `summary` column in the `video_summaries` table for the corresponding `video_id`.
4.  This process only runs for videos that have a `NULL` summary, ensuring we don't re-summarize content.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Create OpenAI Service** (AC: 1, 2)
    - [x] Create a new file at `services/openai.js`.
    - [x] Add the `openai` npm package to the root `package.json`.
    - [x] In `services/openai.js`, implement an async function `generateSummary(transcript)`.
    - [x] This function should take a video transcript as input, call the OpenAI API, and return the generated summary text.
    - [x] The prompt used for the API call must be concise to manage costs, focusing on a brief summary.
    - [x] Ensure the `OPENAI_API_KEY` is loaded securely from environment variables.

- [x] **Task 2: Update Database Helper** (AC: 3)
    - [x] In `db.js`, create and export a new function `updateSummary(videoId, summary)`.
    - [x] This function will execute a SQL `UPDATE` statement to set the `summary` for a given `videoId` in the `video_summaries` table.

- [x] **Task 3: Integrate Summarization into Backend Workflow** (AC: 1, 4)
    - [x] In `server.js`, modify the `/api/refresh-videos` endpoint logic.
    - [x] After fetching video data, identify which videos have a `NULL` value in their `summary` column.
    - [x] For each of these videos, call the `generateSummary` function from `services/openai.js`.
    - [x] On a successful response, call the `updateSummary` function from `db.js` to save the summary.
    - [x] Wrap the API call and database update in a `try/catch` block to handle potential errors gracefully.

## Dev Notes

*   **Architecture & Tech Stack**:
    *   This story builds on the existing Express backend. [Source: `docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md`]
    *   **Database Interaction**: Use raw SQL via the `sqlite3` package as defined in `db.js`. [Source: `docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md`]

*   **External APIs**:
    *   This story introduces a new dependency on the **OpenAI API**. All interaction logic must be encapsulated in `services/openai.js`. [Source: `docs/architecture/6-external-apis.md`]

*   **Data Models & Schema**:
    *   This story updates the `summary` column of the `video_summaries` table. [Source: `docs/architecture/4-data-models.md`]

*   **File Locations**:
    *   Main orchestration logic will be updated in `server.js`. [Source: `docs/architecture/8-source-tree.md`]
    *   New OpenAI service will be in `services/openai.js`. [Source: `docs/architecture/5-components.md`]
    *   Database update function will be in `db.js`. [Source: `docs/architecture/8-source-tree.md`]

*   **Security**:
    *   The `OPENAI_API_KEY` must be loaded from the `.env` file and must not be hardcoded or exposed to the client. [Source: `docs/architecture/12-security-considerations.md`]

*   **Testing**:
    *   Manual testing is required. [Source: `docs/architecture/11-testing-strategy.md`]

## Testing:

*   **Manual Verification Steps:**
    1.  Add a valid `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your `.env` file.
    2.  Ensure at least one video exists in the `video_summaries` table with a `NULL` summary.
    3.  Trigger the `/api/refresh-videos` endpoint using an authenticated session.
    4.  Check the backend server logs for any errors from the OpenAI API call.
    5.  Query the `database.sqlite` file to confirm the `summary` column for the video is now populated with the generated text.
    6.  Trigger the refresh endpoint a second time and verify (via logs) that no new API call is made for the already-summarized video.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-09

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
The implementation for generating and caching summaries is solid. The `services/openai.js` module correctly encapsulates the OpenAI API interaction, and the main workflow in `server.js` properly identifies and processes only the necessary videos. The caching mechanism to avoid re-summarizing content is working as expected.

### Refactoring Performed
None required.

### Compliance Check
- Coding Standards: ✓
- Project Structure: ✓
- Testing Strategy: ✓ (Manual verification is appropriate for this story)
