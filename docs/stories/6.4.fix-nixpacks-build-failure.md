# Story 6.4: Fix Nixpacks Build Failure

## Status: In Progress

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to correct the Nixpacks configuration,
**so that** the application dependencies install correctly and the Railway build can succeed.

## Problem
The Railway build is failing during the `setup` phase with an `undefined variable 'npm-10_x'` error. The `nixpacks.toml` file specifies an invalid Nix package for npm.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. The `nixpacks.toml` file must be updated to specify a valid `nixPkgs` configuration.
2. The corrected configuration must successfully pass the `setup` phase of the Railway build.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Correct `nixpacks.toml`** (AC: 1)
    - [ ] Remove the invalid `npm-10_x` package from the `nixPkgs` array, as `nodejs_20` includes a compatible npm version.

## Dev Notes
*   This is a hotfix for a build configuration error.
*   The `nodejs_20` Nix package provides the correct version of npm automatically.
