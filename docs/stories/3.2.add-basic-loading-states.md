# Story 3.2: Add Basic Loading States

## Status: Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to see loading indicators when data is being fetched,
**so that** I know the application is working and not frozen.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. Loading indicators are displayed when API calls are in progress
2. Loading states are shown for all pages that fetch data from the backend
3. Loading indicators are user-friendly and provide clear feedback
4. The application handles loading states gracefully without showing blank screens

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Implement Loading States on Dashboard Page** (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)
    - [x] Dashboard already has loading states implemented
    - [x] Shows "Loading your video summaries..." during data fetch
    - [x] Has refreshing state for manual refresh operations

- [x] **Task 2: Implement Loading States on Channels Page** (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)
    - [x] Channels page already has loading states implemented
    - [x] Shows "Loading your channels..." during data fetch
    - [x] Has saving state for channel selection operations

- [x] **Task 3: Implement Loading States on Saved Page** (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)
    - [x] Add loading state for when saved videos are being loaded from localStorage
    - [x] Add loading state for when videos are being removed or cleared
    - [x] Ensure smooth user experience during operations

- [x] **Task 4: Implement Loading States on Landing Page** (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)
    - [x] Landing page is basic and doesn't require loading states
    - [x] No authentication functionality present that would need loading states

## Dev Notes

*   **Architecture & Tech Stack**:
    *   **Frontend Library**: React (`~18.2.0`) will be used for implementing loading states. [Source: `docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md`]
    *   **Language**: JavaScript (ES6+) will be used. [Source: `docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md`]
*   **State Management**:
    *   `useState` hook will be used to manage loading states within page components. [Source: `docs/architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md`]
*   **File Locations**:
    *   Loading states for the Saved page will be implemented in `client/src/pages/Saved.js`. [Source: `docs/architecture/5-components.md`, `docs/architecture/8-source-tree.md`]
    *   Loading states for the Landing page will be implemented in `client/src/pages/Landing.js`. [Source: `docs/architecture/5-components.md`, `docs/architecture/8-source-tree.md`]
*   **Coding Standards**:
    *   Follow JavaScript Standard for code style (2 spaces indentation, no semicolons, async/await). [Source: `docs/architecture/10-coding-standards.md`]
    *   Use `camelCase` for variables and functions, `PascalCase` for React components. [Source: `docs/architecture/10-coding-standards.md`]
*   **Testing**:
    *   Manual testing is sufficient for this MVP. [Source: `docs/architecture/11-testing-strategy.md`]

## Implementation Notes

### Implementation Summary:
- ✅ Dashboard.js: Already has comprehensive loading states
- ✅ Channels.js: Already has comprehensive loading states  
- ✅ Saved.js: Added comprehensive loading states for localStorage operations
- ✅ Landing.js: No loading states needed (basic page without async operations)

### Features Implemented:
1. **Saved.js Loading States:**
   - Initial loading state when page loads ("Loading your saved videos...")
   - Individual video removal loading state ("Removing..." button state)
   - Clear all loading state ("Clearing..." button state)
   - Disabled buttons during operations to prevent multiple clicks
   - Visual feedback with opacity changes and cursor states

2. **User Experience Improvements:**
   - Smooth transitions between loading and loaded states
   - Clear visual feedback for all user actions
   - Prevention of multiple simultaneous operations
   - Consistent loading patterns across all pages

### Testing Completed:
- ✅ All loading states display correctly
- ✅ Buttons are properly disabled during operations
- ✅ Visual feedback is clear and user-friendly
- ✅ No race conditions or multiple simultaneous operations
