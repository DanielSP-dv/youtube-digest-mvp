# Story 3.2: Add Basic Loading States

## Status: Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to see loading indicators when data is being fetched,
**so that** I know the application is working and not frozen.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. Loading indicators are displayed when API calls are in progress
2. Loading states are shown for all pages that fetch data from the backend
3. Loading indicators are user-friendly and provide clear feedback
4. The application handles loading states gracefully without showing blank screens

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Implement Loading States on Dashboard Page** (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)
    - [x] Dashboard already has loading states implemented
    - [x] Shows "Loading your video summaries..." during data fetch
    - [x] Has refreshing state for manual refresh operations

- [x] **Task 2: Implement Loading States on Channels Page** (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)
    - [x] Channels page already has loading states implemented
    - [x] Shows "Loading your channels..." during data fetch
    - [x] Has saving state for channel selection operations

- [x] **Task 3: Implement Loading States on Saved Page** (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)
    - [x] Add loading state for when saved videos are being loaded from localStorage
    - [x] Add loading state for when videos are being removed or cleared
    - [x] Ensure smooth user experience during operations

- [x] **Task 4: Implement Loading States on Landing Page** (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)
    - [x] Landing page is basic and doesn't require loading states
    - [x] No authentication functionality present that would need loading states

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-09

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
The implementation of loading states is excellent. Each page that performs an asynchronous operation (`Dashboard`, `Channels`, `Saved`) correctly uses a loading state variable to provide clear feedback to the user. The button disabling and text changes during these states (e.g., "Saving...", "Refreshing...") enhance the user experience by preventing duplicate actions and communicating system status.
