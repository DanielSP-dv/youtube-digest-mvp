# Story 3.2: Add Basic Loading States

## Status: Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to see loading indicators when the application is fetching data,
**so that** I know the system is working and I'm not looking at a frozen page.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1.  A loading message or spinner is displayed on the `/channels` page while subscriptions are being fetched.
2.  A loading message or spinner is displayed on the `/dashboard` page while summaries are being fetched.
3.  The "Refresh" button on the dashboard is disabled and shows a "Refreshing..." state while the backend is processing new videos.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Implement Loading State on Channels Page** (AC: 1)
    - [x] In `client/src/pages/Channels.js`, add a `loading` state variable.
    - [x] Set `loading` to `true` before fetching subscriptions and `false` after fetching (or on error).
    - [x] Conditionally render a loading message (e.g., "Loading your channels...") when `loading` is `true`.

- [x] **Task 2: Implement Loading State on Dashboard Page** (AC: 2)
    - [x] In `client/src/pages/Dashboard.js`, add a `loading` state variable.
    - [x] Set `loading` to `true` before fetching dashboard data and `false` after fetching (or on error).
    - [x] Conditionally render a loading message (e.g., "Loading your video summaries...") when `loading` is `true`.

- [x] **Task 3: Implement Refresh Button Loading State on Dashboard** (AC: 3)
    - [x] In `client/src/pages/Dashboard.js`, use the existing `refreshing` state variable.
    - [x] Disable the "Refresh Videos" button when `refreshing` is `true`.
    - [x] Change the button text to "Refreshing..." when `refreshing` is `true`.

## Dev Notes

*   **Architecture & Tech Stack**:
    *   **Frontend Library**: React (`~18.2.0`) will be used for implementing loading states. [Source: `docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md`]
    *   **Language**: JavaScript (ES6+) will be used. [Source: `docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md`]
*   **State Management**:
    *   `useState` hook will be used to manage loading states within `Channels.js` and `Dashboard.js` components. [Source: `docs/architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md`]
*   **File Locations**:
    *   Loading indicators for the Channels page will be implemented in `client/src/pages/Channels.js`. [Source: `docs/architecture/5-components.md`, `docs/architecture/8-source-tree.md`]
    *   Loading indicators and button disabling for the Dashboard page will be implemented in `client/src/pages/Dashboard.js`. [Source: `docs/architecture/5-components.md`, `docs/architecture/8-source-tree.md`]
*   **Coding Standards**:
    *   Follow JavaScript Standard for code style (2 spaces indentation, no semicolons, async/await). [Source: `docs/architecture/10-coding-standards.md`]
    *   Ensure `try/catch` blocks are used for async functions. [Source: `docs/architecture/10-coding-standards.md`]
    *   Use `camelCase` for variables and functions, `PascalCase` for React components. [Source: `docs/architecture/10-coding-standards.md`]
*   **Testing**:
    *   Manual testing is sufficient for this MVP. [Source: `docs/architecture/11-testing-strategy.md`]
