# Story 6.1: Analyze Project for Unused Files

## Status: In Progress

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to analyze the project and identify unnecessary files from previous versions,
**so that** the codebase is clean, easier to navigate, and less confusing.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. A complete list of all files in the project directory must be generated.
2. A dependency trace from the application entry points (`server.js`, `client/src/index.js`) must be performed to identify all essential application files.
3. All BMad process and documentation files (`.bmad-core/**`, `docs/**`, `.gemini/**`) must be identified as critical and preserved.
4. A final report must be presented, categorizing all files into "Essential App Files," "Essential Process Files," and "Potentially Orphaned Files."
5. No files will be deleted as part of this story. Deletion will be handled in a separate, subsequent task based on the findings here.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Generate Full File Listing** (AC: 1)
    - [ ] Recursively list every file and directory in the project root.

- [ ] **Task 2: Analyze Application Dependencies** (AC: 2)
    - [ ] Read `server.js` and `client/src/index.js` to identify direct and transitive dependencies.
    - [ ] Map out all required `.js`, `.css`, and other asset files for the application to function.

- [ ] **Task 3: Identify Critical Process Files** (AC: 3)
    - [ ] Explicitly list all files within `.bmad-core/`, `docs/`, and `.gemini/` as non-deletable process files.

- [ ] **Task 4: Generate and Present Analysis Report** (AC: 4)
    - [ ] Compare the full file list with the lists of essential app files and process files.
    - [ ] Produce a final report categorizing every file.

## Dev Notes
*   This is a critical refactoring task to reduce project clutter and confusion from the architectural pivot.
*   Extreme caution is required. No files will be deleted automatically. This story is for analysis only.
*   The `apps/` and `packages/` directories are suspected to be remnants of a previous T3 stack architecture and are primary candidates for removal, but this must be verified.
