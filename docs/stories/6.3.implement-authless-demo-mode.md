# Story 6.3: Implement Auth-less Demo Mode

## Status: In Progress

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to implement an auth-less 'demo mode' for the application,
**so that** we can quickly deploy a publicly accessible version for feedback without dealing with cookie and OAuth complexities.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. When the `DEMO_MODE` environment variable is `'true'`, `server.js` must inject a mock user into all requests.
2. When `DEMO_MODE` is `'true'`, `server.js` must skip initializing session and passport middleware.
3. When the `REACT_APP_DEMO` environment variable is `'true'`, `client/src/App.js` must use a mock user and disable the `login` and `logout` functions.
4. The application must be deployable to Railway using this new demo mode.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Implement Demo Middleware in `server.js`** (AC: 1, 2)
    - [ ] Add middleware to `server.js` that creates a `req.user` object when `DEMO_MODE` is true.
    - [ ] Wrap the existing `cors`, `session`, and `passport` middleware initializations in a conditional block to skip them in demo mode.

- [ ] **Task 2: Implement Demo Mode in `client/src/App.js`** (AC: 3)
    - [ ] Update the `useEffect` hook to short-circuit the auth check and set a mock user if `REACT_APP_DEMO` is true.
    - [ ] Update the `login` and `logout` functions to be no-ops in demo mode.

- [ ] **Task 3: Verify `api.js`**
    - [ ] Ensure `client/src/api.js` uses a relative path by defaulting `API_BASE_URL` to `''`.

## Dev Notes
*   This story provides a fast path to a public demo by bypassing authentication complexities.
*   **User Action Required**: To enable this mode, set `DEMO_MODE=true` in the backend environment (e.g., Railway variables) and `REACT_APP_DEMO=true` in the frontend build environment.
