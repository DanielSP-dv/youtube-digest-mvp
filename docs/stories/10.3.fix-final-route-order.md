# Story 10.3: Correct Final Express Route Order for API 404s

## Status: In Progress

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to fix the final route ordering in `server.js`,
**so that** API calls are correctly handled and do not result in 404 errors.

## Problem
API requests are being ignored by the SPA catch-all route but are not being handled by any other route because the API route definitions are placed after the catch-all. This causes Express to return a default 404 Not Found error.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. The `server.js` file must be rewritten to ensure all routes starting with `/api/` and `/auth/` are defined before the `express.static` and `app.get('*', ...)` middleware.
2. API calls made from the client must successfully reach their handlers and return JSON data.
3. The application must be fully functional on Railway.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Correct Route Order in `server.js`** (AC: 1)
    - [ ] Read the current `server.js` file.
    - [ ] Overwrite the file with a new version that has the middleware and routes in the correct, final order.

## Dev Notes
*   This is the definitive fix for the 404 errors on API calls.
