# Story 7.1: Enable Production OAuth Flow

## Status: In Progress

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to disable demo mode and fully enable the production Google OAuth flow on Railway,
**so that** real users can authenticate and use the application with their own data.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. `DEMO_MODE` and `REACT_APP_DEMO` are set to `false` in the Railway deployment environment.
2. The `CALLBACK_URL` environment variable is correctly configured in both Railway and the Google Cloud Console.
3. A user can successfully authenticate via the Google login flow on the live Railway deployment.
4. After authentication, the application successfully fetches the user's real data (e.g., YouTube subscriptions).

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Disable Demo Mode (User Action)** (AC: 1)
    - [ ] In the Railway project variables, set `DEMO_MODE` to `false`.
    - [ ] In the Railway project variables, set `REACT_APP_DEMO` to `false`.

- [ ] **Task 2: Verify Google OAuth Configuration (User Action)** (AC: 2)
    - [ ] Confirm the `CALLBACK_URL` in Railway is `https://youtube-digest-mvp-production.up.railway.app/auth/google/callback`.
    - [ ] In the Google Cloud Console, for your OAuth 2.0 Client ID, ensure that `https://youtube-digest-mvp-production.up.railway.app/auth/google/callback` is listed as an **Authorized redirect URI**.

- [ ] **Task 3: Deploy and Analyze (Joint Task)** (AC: 3, 4)
    - [ ] User to trigger a new deployment after completing Tasks 1 & 2.
    - [ ] I will stand by to analyze the new deployment logs for any CORS, cookie, or OAuth-related errors.

## Dev Notes
*   This story transitions the application from a public, auth-less demo to a real, user-authenticated service.
*   Success depends on the correct configuration of environment variables and Google Cloud Console settings, which I cannot access directly.
*   Common errors to watch for are `redirect_uri_mismatch` from Google, or CORS errors in the browser console.
