# Story 8.3: Rename JSX Files for Vite Compatibility

## Status: In Progress

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to rename all React component files to use the `.jsx` extension,
**so that** the Vite build process can correctly parse them.

## Problem
The Vite build is failing because files containing JSX syntax have a `.js` extension. Vite requires a `.jsx` (or `.tsx`) extension to correctly parse JSX.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. All React component files in `client/src/` and `client/src/pages/` must be renamed from `.js` to `.jsx`.
2. The script tag in `client/index.html` must be updated to point to `/src/index.jsx`.
3. The application must build successfully with Vite after the files are renamed.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Rename Core Component Files** (AC: 1)
    - [ ] Rename `client/src/App.js` to `client/src/App.jsx`.
    - [ ] Rename `client/src/index.js` to `client/src/index.jsx`.

- [ ] **Task 2: Rename Page Component Files** (AC: 1)
    - [ ] List all files in `client/src/pages`.
    - [ ] Rename all `.js` files in that directory to `.jsx`.

- [ ] **Task 3: Update `index.html`** (AC: 2)
    - [ ] Modify `client/index.html` to change the script source to `/src/index.jsx`.

## Dev Notes
*   This is a required fix for the Vite migration. Vite is stricter than Create React App about file extensions for JSX content.
