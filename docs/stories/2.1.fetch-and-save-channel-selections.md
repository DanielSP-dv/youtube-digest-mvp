## Status: Done

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-09

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation for Story 2.1 aligns well with the architectural guidelines and coding standards. The backend endpoints are properly authenticated, and the frontend handles the display and selection logic as expected. The use of `credentials: 'include'` for API calls is correctly implemented.

### Refactoring Performed

None required.

## Story
**As a** logged-in user,
**I want** to view my YouTube subscriptions and save up to 10 channels,
**so that** I can specify which channels to get digests for.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1.  On the `/channels` page, an API call is made to fetch the user's YouTube subscriptions using their stored OAuth token.
2.  The list of channels is displayed with checkboxes.
3.  The user can select up to 10 channels.
4.  Clicking a "Save" button sends the selected channel IDs to the backend.
5.  The backend saves the `user_id` and `channel_id` pairs into the `selected_channels` table, replacing any previous selections for that user.
6.  Previously saved selections are pre-filled when the user revisits the page.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Create Backend Endpoint for YouTube Subscriptions** (AC: 1)
    - [x] In `server.js`, create a new authenticated GET endpoint at `/api/subscriptions`.
    - [x] This endpoint should use the `access_token` from the logged-in user's session to call the YouTube Data API's `subscriptions.list` endpoint.
    - [x] The response should be a JSON array of the user's subscribed channels, including channel ID, name, and thumbnail.
    - [x] Add this endpoint to the `services/youtube.js` file.

- [x] **Task 2: Create Backend Endpoint to Save Selections** (AC: 4, 5)
    - [x] In `server.js`, create a new authenticated POST endpoint at `/api/channels`.
    - [x] This endpoint should accept a JSON body with an array of `channel_ids`.
    - [x] It should first delete any existing records in the `selected_channels` table for the current `user_id`.
    - [x] It should then insert the new channel selections into the `selected_channels` table.

- [x] **Task 3: Create Backend Endpoint to Get Saved Selections** (AC: 6)
    - [x] In `server.js`, create a new authenticated GET endpoint at `/api/channels`.
    - [x] This endpoint should query the `selected_channels` table for the current `user_id` and return the list of saved channel IDs.

- [x] **Task 4: Implement Frontend Channel Selection Page** (AC: 1, 2, 3, 6)
    - [x] In `client/src/pages/Channels.js`, on component mount, make a GET request to `/api/subscriptions`.
    - [x] Make a separate GET request to `/api/channels` to fetch previously saved selections.
    - [x] Render the list of subscriptions as a list of items with checkboxes.
    - [x] Use the list of saved channels to pre-check the appropriate checkboxes.
    - [x] Disable checkboxes if the user has already selected 10 channels.
    - [x] Add a "Save" button.

- [x] **Task 5: Implement Frontend Save Logic** (AC: 4)
    - [x] When the "Save" button is clicked in `Channels.js`, collect the IDs of all checked channels.
    - [x] Make a POST request to `/api/channels` with the array of selected channel IDs in the request body.
    - [x] Show a confirmation message to the user upon successful save.

## Dev Notes

*   **Architecture & Tech Stack**:
    *   This story builds on the existing Express backend and React frontend.
    *   **Backend**: Use `express` and raw SQL with the `sqlite3` package. All new endpoints will be added to `server.js`. [Source: `docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md`]
    *   **Frontend**: Use `react` and `react-router-dom`. API calls should be managed through `client/src/api.js`. [Source: `docs/architecture/5-components.md`]

*   **External APIs**:
    *   This story requires interaction with the **YouTube Data API**. Specifically the `subscriptions.list` endpoint. Ensure the `youtube.js` service encapsulates this call. [Source: `docs/architecture/6-external-apis.md`]

*   **Data Models & Schema**:
    *   This story will heavily interact with the `selected_channels` table. The schema is defined in `docs/architecture/7-database-schema.md`.
    *   The `users` table will be read to get the `access_token`.

*   **Security**:
    *   All new backend endpoints must be authenticated, ensuring a user can only access their own subscriptions and selections.
    *   The user's `access_token` must be handled securely on the backend and never exposed to the client. [Source: `docs/architecture/12-security-considerations.md`]

*   **Testing**:
    *   Manual testing is sufficient for this MVP. Follow the testing checklist in `docs/architecture/11-testing-strategy.md` to verify functionality.
