# Story 8.2: Update Root Build Configuration for Vite

## Status: In Progress

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to update the root `package.json` and `nixpacks.toml` configurations,
**so that** the deployment process correctly builds the new Vite client application.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. The `build` script in the root `package.json` must be updated to correctly install dependencies and run the Vite build command in the `/client` directory.
2. The `nixpacks.toml` configuration must be verified to correctly install dependencies and run the Vite build command for deployment.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Update Root `package.json` Build Script** (AC: 1)
    - [ ] Modify the `scripts.build` entry to run `cd client && npm install && npm run build`.

- [ ] **Task 2: Verify `nixpacks.toml` Configuration** (AC: 2)
    - [ ] Review the `nixpacks.toml` file to ensure its `install` and `build` commands are compatible with the new Vite setup.

## Dev Notes
*   This story finalizes the Vite migration by ensuring the root project and deployment configurations can correctly build the new client.
