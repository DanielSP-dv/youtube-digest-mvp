# Story 2.0: Improve Developer Run Instructions and Troubleshooting

## Status: Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** clear and comprehensive instructions for setting up and running the application, along with common troubleshooting steps,
**so that** I can quickly get the development environment working and resolve issues efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1.  Following the README steps from a clean clone leads to a working backend and frontend.
2.  The README includes clear instructions for installing dependencies for both root and client.
3.  The README clearly states the required ports for backend (5001) and frontend (3000), and the client proxy setting.
4.  The README provides troubleshooting guidance for "address already in use" (EADDRINUSE) errors on port 5001.
5.  The README provides troubleshooting guidance for JSON parse errors in `package.json` due to comments.
