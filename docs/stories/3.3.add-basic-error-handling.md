# Story 3.3: Add Basic Error Handling

## Status: Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to see a clear message if something goes wrong,
**so that** I am not left with a blank or broken page.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1.  If an API call to the backend fails, a user-friendly error message (e.g., "Could not load data. Please try again later.") is displayed on the relevant page.
2.  Sensitive error details are not exposed to the user in the UI.
3.  The application does not crash on a failed API call.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Implement Error Display on Channels Page** (AC: 1, 2, 3)
    - [x] In `client/src/pages/Channels.js`, ensure the `error` state variable is used to display a user-friendly message.
    - [x] Verify that sensitive error details are not exposed.
    - [x] Confirm the application does not crash on API failure.

- [x] **Task 2: Implement Error Display on Dashboard Page** (AC: 1, 2, 3)
    - [x] In `client/src/pages/Dashboard.js`, ensure the `error` state variable is used to display a user-friendly message.
    - [x] Verify that sensitive error details are not exposed.
    - [x] Confirm the application does not crash on API failure.

- [x] **Task 3: Centralize API Error Handling (Optional but Recommended)**
    - [x] Review `client/src/api.js` to ensure it throws errors that can be caught by page components.
    - [x] Consider adding a global error handler or a more robust error display component if patterns emerge.

## Dev Notes

*   **Architecture & Tech Stack**:
    *   **Frontend Library**: React (`~18.2.0`) will be used for implementing error handling. [Source: `docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md`]
    *   **Language**: JavaScript (ES6+) will be used. [Source: `docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md`]
*   **State Management**:
    *   `useState` hook will be used to manage error states within `Channels.js` and `Dashboard.js` components. [Source: `docs/architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md`]
*   **File Locations**:
    *   Error handling for the Channels page will be implemented in `client/src/pages/Channels.js`. [Source: `docs/architecture/5-components.md`, `docs/architecture/8-source-tree.md`]
    *   Error handling for the Dashboard page will be implemented in `client/src/pages/Dashboard.js`. [Source: `docs/architecture/5-components.md`, `docs/architecture/8-source-tree.md`]
    *   Centralized API error handling (if implemented) will be in `client/src/api.js`. [Source: `docs/architecture/5-components.md`, `docs/architecture/8-source-tree.md`]
*   **Coding Standards**:
    *   Follow JavaScript Standard for code style (2 spaces indentation, no semicolons, async/await). [Source: `docs/architecture/10-coding-standards.md`]
    *   Ensure `try/catch` blocks are used for async functions. [Source: `docs/architecture/10-coding-standards.md`]
    *   Use `camelCase` for variables and functions, `PascalCase` for React components. [Source: `docs/architecture/10-coding-standards.md`]
*   **Testing**:
    *   Manual testing is sufficient for this MVP. [Source: `docs/architecture/11-testing-strategy.md`]
