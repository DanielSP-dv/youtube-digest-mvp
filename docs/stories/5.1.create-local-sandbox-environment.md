# Story 5.1: Create Local Sandbox Environment

## Status: Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to create a stable, isolated sandbox environment from a known-good commit,
**so that** I can continue new feature development locally while the main branch is used for deployment fixes.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. A git tag `mvp_local_good` must be created on commit `cd96291`.
2. A new git branch `sandbox` must be created from the `mvp_local_good` tag.
3. A new `git worktree` must be created at `../FINALMVP-sandbox` linked to the `sandbox` branch.
4. The `sandbox` worktree must be fully functional and capable of running locally, separate from the main project directory.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Tag the known-good commit** (AC: 1)
    - [x] Run `git tag mvp_local_good cd96291`

- [x] **Task 2: Create the `sandbox` branch** (AC: 2)
    - [x] Run `git branch sandbox mvp_local_good`

- [x] **Task 3: Create the `git worktree`** (AC: 3)
    - [x] Run `git worktree add ../FINALMVP-sandbox sandbox`

- [ ] **Task 4: Push sandbox branch and tags to remote (Optional but Recommended)**
    - [ ] Run `git push origin sandbox`
    - [ ] Run `git push origin --tags`

## Dev Notes
*   This story establishes a stable, parallel development environment using `git worktree`.
*   The sandbox environment is located at `../FINALMVP-sandbox`.
*   **Critical User Action**: After this story is complete, you must navigate to the new `../FINALMVP-sandbox` directory and create a `.env.local` file with its own `DATABASE_URL` (e.g., `file:./sandbox.db`) and `PORT` to ensure it runs independently from the main repository.
*   Run `npm install` (or `pnpm install`) inside the new worktree directory before starting the server.
