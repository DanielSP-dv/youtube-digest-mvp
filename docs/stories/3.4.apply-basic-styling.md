# Story 3.4: Apply Basic Styling

## Status: Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to apply minimal, clean styling to the application,
**so that** it is presentable and usable for the demo.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1.  A simple, consistent layout is applied to all pages (Login, Channels, Dashboard, Saved).
2.  Buttons, lists, and text are styled for readability using basic CSS.
3.  The application has a clean and professional, yet minimal, look, avoiding unpolished default browser styles.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Apply Global Styles** (AC: 1, 3)
    - [x] In `client/src/index.css` or `client/src/App.css`, define basic styles for the body, fonts, and a simple color scheme to ensure a consistent look and feel.
    - [x] Update the main layout in `client/src/App.js` to have a max-width and be centered on the page for better readability on wider screens.

- [x] **Task 2: Style the Header/Navigation** (AC: 1)
    - [x] In `client/src/App.js`, improve the styling of the header, navigation links, and the user/logout section to be more visually organized.

- [x] **Task 3: Style the Dashboard and Saved Pages** (AC: 2, 3)
    - [x] In `client/src/pages/Dashboard.js` and `client/src/pages/Saved.js`, style the summary cards to have clear borders, padding, and a clean layout.
    - [x] Style the buttons on these pages to have a consistent and modern look.

- [x] **Task 4: Style the Channels Page** (AC: 2, 3)
    - [x] In `client/src/pages/Channels.js`, style the channel list to be more readable.
    - [x] Ensure the checkboxes and labels are well-aligned and easy to click.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-09

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
The implementation of the styling is excellent. A global stylesheet (`index.css`) has been used to create a consistent and clean design system with reusable classes for cards, buttons, and layout containers. The React components have been updated to use these classes instead of inline styles, which greatly improves maintainability. The final result is a professional and polished user interface that aligns with the MVP's design goals.
