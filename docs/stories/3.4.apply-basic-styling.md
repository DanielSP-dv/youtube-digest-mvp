# Story 3.4: Apply Basic Styling

## Status: Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to apply minimal, clean styling to the application,
**so that** it is presentable and usable for the demo.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1.  A simple, consistent layout is applied to all pages (Login, Channels, Dashboard, Saved).
2.  Buttons, lists, and text are styled for readability using basic CSS.
3.  The application has a clean and professional, yet minimal, look, avoiding unpolished default browser styles.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Apply Global Styles** (AC: 1, 3)
    - [x] In `client/src/index.css` or `client/src/App.css`, define basic styles for the body, fonts, and a simple color scheme to ensure a consistent look and feel.
    - [x] Update the main layout in `client/src/App.js` to have a max-width and be centered on the page for better readability on wider screens.

- [x] **Task 2: Style the Header/Navigation** (AC: 1)
    - [x] In `client/src/App.js`, improve the styling of the header, navigation links, and the user/logout section to be more visually organized.

- [x] **Task 3: Style the Dashboard and Saved Pages** (AC: 2, 3)
    - [x] In `client/src/pages/Dashboard.js` and `client/src/pages/Saved.js`, style the summary cards to have clear borders, padding, and a clean layout.
    - [x] Style the buttons on these pages to have a consistent and modern look.

- [x] **Task 4: Style the Channels Page** (AC: 2, 3)
    - [x] In `client/src/pages/Channels.js`, style the channel list to be more readable.
    - [x] Ensure the checkboxes and labels are well-aligned and easy to click.

## Dev Notes

    *   **Frontend Library**: This story focuses on the **React** (`~18.2.0`) frontend. [Source: `docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md`]
    *   **Styling**: Styling will be done with plain CSS in the existing `.css` files. No new CSS frameworks should be introduced. [Source: `docs/prd.md#branding`]

*   **File Locations**:
    *   Global styles will be in `client/src/App.css` or `client/src/index.css`.
    *   Component-specific layout and structure will be modified in:

*   **Testing**:
    *   All validation for this story will be **manual**. The developer should visually inspect each page to ensure it meets the acceptance criteria. [Source: `docs/architecture/11-testing-strategy.md`]
