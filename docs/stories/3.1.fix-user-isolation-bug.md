# Story 3.1: Fix User Isolation Bug in Video Summaries

## Status: Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to see only the video summaries from my selected channels,
**so that** my dashboard is not cluttered with irrelevant content and my data is kept private.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1.  The `/api/dashboard` endpoint returns only the video summaries for the authenticated user.
2.  The `/api/refresh-videos` endpoint processes videos only for the authenticated user.
3.  The `video_summaries` table correctly stores the `user_id` for each summary.
4.  Users can no longer see video summaries from other users' channels.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Update Database Schema**
    - [x] Alter the `video_summaries` table to add a `user_id` column.
    - [x] Create indexes on the new column for performance.
    - [x] Backfill the `user_id` for existing records.

- [x] **Task 2: Update `db.js`**
    - [x] Add `getUserVideoSummaries` and `getUserVideoStats` functions to `db.js`.
    - [x] Update `module.exports` in `db.js` to include the new functions.

- [x] **Task 3: Update `server.js`**
    - [x] Replace the `/api/refresh-videos` endpoint with a version that handles user isolation.
    - [x] Replace the `/api/dashboard` endpoint with a version that handles user isolation.
    - [x] Remove the hardcoded user override from `server.js`.

## Dev Notes

*   This story addresses a critical user isolation bug where all users were seeing all video summaries.
*   The fix involves a database migration, updates to two API endpoints, and the addition of two new database functions.
