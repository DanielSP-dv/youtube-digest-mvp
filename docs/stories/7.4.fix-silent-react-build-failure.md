# Story 7.4: Fix Silent React Build Failure

## Status: In Progress

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to prevent the React build process from running out of memory,
**so that** the production build completes successfully and generates all necessary static assets.

## Problem
The `npm run build` command is failing silently on Railway, likely due to an out-of-memory error. It creates a partial `build` directory but does not generate the `index.html` or the final JavaScript/CSS assets, causing the deployment to fail at runtime.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. The `GENERATE_SOURCEMAP` environment variable is set to `false` in the production build environment.
2. The `npm run build` command successfully creates a complete `build` directory, including `index.html`, `asset-manifest.json`, and the hashed `main.js` and `main.css` files.
3. A new deployment on Railway is successful and the application loads correctly.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Diagnose Silent Build Failure** (AC: 1)
    - [x] Analyzed build logs to confirm that `npm run build` was not generating all required files.
    - [x] Hypothesized an out-of-memory error as the root cause.

- [ ] **Task 2: Document Environment Variable Fix (User Action)** (AC: 1)
    - [ ] Create this story to document the fix.
    - [ ] Instruct the user to set `GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false` in their Railway project variables.

- [ ] **Task 3: Verify the Fix** (AC: 2, 3)
    - [ ] Awaiting user to set the variable and redeploy.
    - [ ] The fix will be verified by inspecting the new build logs and testing the live application URL.

## Dev Notes
*   Disabling source maps is a standard practice for production React builds to reduce build time and memory consumption.
