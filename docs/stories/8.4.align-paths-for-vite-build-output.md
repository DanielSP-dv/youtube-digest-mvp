# Story 8.4: Align Project Paths for Vite Build Output

## Status: In Progress

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to update all project configurations to use the `dist` directory for the client build output,
**so that** the server and deployment scripts can find the assets generated by Vite.

## Problem
Following the migration to Vite, the client build output directory changed from `build` to `dist`. However, `server.js`, `nixpacks.toml`, and `.gitignore` still reference the old `build` directory, causing the deployment to fail.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. All references to `client/build` in `server.js` must be changed to `client/dist`.
2. All references to `client/build` in `nixpacks.toml` must be changed to `client/dist`.
3. The `client/.gitignore` file must be updated to ignore the `/dist` directory.
4. The application must deploy successfully on Railway.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Update `server.js` Paths** (AC: 1)
    - [ ] Replace all instances of `client/build` with `client/dist`.

- [ ] **Task 2: Update `nixpacks.toml` Paths** (AC: 2)
    - [ ] Replace all instances of `client/build` with `client/dist`.

- [ ] **Task 3: Update `.gitignore`** (AC: 3)
    - [ ] In `client/.gitignore`, add `/dist` to the list of ignored directories.

## Dev Notes
*   This is the final configuration fix for the Vite migration. It standardizes the project on Vite's default output directory.
