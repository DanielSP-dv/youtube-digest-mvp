# Story 1.2: Frontend Application Shell

## Status: Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to create a basic React application with placeholder pages and routing,
**so that** we have a navigable frontend structure.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1.  A `create-react-app` project is initialized within the `client` directory.
2.  Basic client-side routing is set up for the routes: `/` (Login), `/dashboard`, and `/channels`.
3.  A persistent header component is created.
4.  The header displays a "Login" button if no user is authenticated.
5.  The header displays the user's email and a "Logout" button if a user is authenticated.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Initialize React App** (AC: 1)
    - [x] In the project root, run `npx create-react-app client`.
    - [x] Clean up the default `create-react-app` boilerplate (e.g., remove logos, default CSS).
    - [x] Configure the client `package.json` to proxy API requests to the backend server (e.g., `"proxy": "http://localhost:3001"`).

- [x] **Task 2: Implement Client-Side Routing** (AC: 2)
    - [x] Install `react-router-dom`.
    - [x] In `client/src/App.js`, set up routes for `/`, `/dashboard`, and `/channels`.
    - [x] Create simple placeholder components for each page (`Landing.js`, `Dashboard.js`, `Channels.js`).

- [x] **Task 3: Create Persistent Header** (AC: 3, 4, 5)
    - [x] Create a `Header.js` component or add the logic directly to `App.js`.
    - [x] The header should contain navigation links for the defined pages.
    - [x] Implement logic to fetch the user's session from the `/api/current_user` endpoint.
    - [x] Conditionally render the "Login" button or the user's email and "Logout" button based on the authentication status.
