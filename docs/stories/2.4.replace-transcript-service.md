# Story 2.4: Replace Transcript Service with Supadata

## Status: Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to replace the current video transcript fetching mechanism with the Supadata API,
**so that** we improve the reliability and maintainability of transcript retrieval.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1.  The `getVideoTranscript` function in `services/transcript.js` is updated to use the Supadata API.
2.  The updated `getVideoTranscript` function successfully fetches transcripts for YouTube videos.
3.  The `SUPADATA_API_KEY` is securely loaded from environment variables and used for Supadata API authentication.
4.  The application continues to successfully generate video summaries using transcripts fetched via Supadata.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Implement Supadata Integration in `services/transcript.js`** (AC: 1, 2, 4)
    - [x] Remove any existing `youtube-transcript` or `SearchAPI` related code.
    - [x] Modify the `getVideoTranscript` function to make a `GET` request to `https://api.supadata.ai/v1/transcript`.
    - [x] Include the video URL as a query parameter (e.g., `?url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=${videoId}`).
    - [x] Set the `x-api-key` header with the `SUPADATA_API_KEY`.
    - [x] Parse the Supadata API response to extract the transcript text.
    - [x] Implement robust error handling for Supadata API calls.

- [x] **Task 2: Configure Environment Variables** (AC: 3)
    - [x] Add `SUPADATA_API_KEY` to the `.env.example` file.
    - [x] Ensure instructions are clear for adding `SUPADATA_API_KEY` to the local `.env` file.

- [x] **Task 3: Verify End-to-End Functionality** (AC: 2, 4)
    - [x] Manually test the `getVideoTranscript` function in isolation to confirm it returns valid transcripts.
    - [x] Trigger the `/api/refresh-videos` endpoint and verify that video summaries are successfully generated, indicating correct transcript fetching via Supadata.

## Dev Notes

*   **Architecture & Tech Stack**:
    *   This story updates the external API for transcript fetching. The tech stack now includes `Supadata`. [Source: `docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md`]
    *   Backend is built with Express.js. [Source: `docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md`]
    *   Database interaction uses raw SQL via `sqlite3`. [Source: `docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md`]

*   **External APIs**:
    *   This story replaces `SearchAPI` with `Supadata` for video transcript fetching. [Source: `docs/architecture/6-external-apis.md`]
    *   `Supadata` API details:
        *   Purpose: To fetch video transcripts from various platforms.
        *   Documentation: `https://docs.supadata.ai/`
        *   Base URL: `https://api.supadata.ai/v1`
        *   Authentication: API Key in `x-api-key` header.
        *   Key Endpoints: `/youtube/transcript`.
        *   Integration Notes: Secure storage of `SUPADATA_API_KEY` in environment variables. [Source: `docs/architecture/7-external-apis.md`]

*   **File Locations**:
    *   The main logic for transcript fetching is in `services/transcript.js`. [Source: `docs/architecture/8-source-tree.md`]
    *   Environment variables are loaded from `.env`. [Source: `docs/architecture/12-security-considerations.md`]

*   **Security**:
    *   `SUPADATA_API_KEY` must be loaded securely from environment variables and not hardcoded or exposed to the client. [Source: `docs/architecture/12-security-considerations.md`]

*   **Testing**:
    *   Manual testing is the primary approach for MVP. [Source: `docs/architecture/11-testing-strategy.md`]

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-07

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The `services/transcript.js` file has been correctly updated to use the Supadata API. **CRITICAL FINDING**: The working endpoint was found to be `GET https://api.supadata.ai/v1/transcript` with a `url` parameter, contrary to the story's original requirement of `POST https://api.supadata.ai/v1/youtube/transcript` with `videoId` in the body. The user has updated the service to use the working GET endpoint. The hardcoded API key fallback and unused `videoUrl` have been removed. Error handling is in place. The temporary 2-video limit in `server.js` is noted as a valid temporary measure for testing.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `services/transcript.js`
  - **Change**: Updated Supadata API call to `GET https://api.supadata.ai/v1/transcript` with `url` parameter.
  - **Why**: The originally specified POST endpoint was returning a 404 error, and the GET endpoint was found to be working correctly.
  - **How**: Modified the `getVideoTranscript` function to use the working GET endpoint and updated response parsing.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓
- Project Structure: ✓
- Testing Strategy: ✓
- All ACs Met: ✓ (based on the working GET endpoint)

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] **CRITICAL**: Update Story 2.4 Acceptance Criteria and Tasks to reflect the correct Supadata API endpoint and method (`GET /v1/transcript` with `url` parameter).
- [ ] Remove temporary 2-video processing limit in `server.js` before production deployment.

### Security Review

- `SUPADATA_API_KEY` is loaded securely from environment variables.

### Performance Considerations

- The temporary 2-video limit helps manage API usage and cost during testing.

### Files Modified During Review
