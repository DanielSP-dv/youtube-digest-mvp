# Story 2.5: Display Summaries on Dashboard

## Status: Done

## Story
**As a** logged-in user,
**I want** to see the latest video summaries on my dashboard,
**so that** I can quickly consume the content.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1.  The `/dashboard` page fetches all records from the `video_summaries` table that belong to the user's selected channels.
2.  The summaries are displayed in a simple list, ordered by creation date (newest first).
3.  Each item in the list shows the video title and the summary text.
4.  A manual "Refresh" button on the dashboard triggers the `/api/refresh-videos` endpoint to fetch new content.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Implement Dashboard Page** (AC: 1, 2, 3)
    - [x] In `client/src/pages/Dashboard.js`, on component mount, make a GET request to `/api/dashboard`.
    - [x] Render the list of summaries received from the API.
    - [x] For each summary, display the video title and the summary text.

- [x] **Task 2: Implement Refresh Button** (AC: 4)
    - [x] Add a "Refresh" button to the `Dashboard.js` page.
    - [x] When the button is clicked, make a GET request to `/api/refresh-videos`.
    - [x] After the refresh is complete, re-fetch the dashboard data to display any new summaries.

## Dev Notes

*   **Architecture & Tech Stack**:
    *   **Frontend**: This story involves updating the React frontend. Use `react` and `react-router-dom`. API calls should be managed through `client/src/api.js`. [Source: `docs/architecture/5-components.md`]
    *   **Backend**: The `/api/dashboard` and `/api/refresh-videos` endpoints are already implemented. This story focuses on the frontend consumption of these endpoints.

*   **API Specifications**:
    *   **GET /api/dashboard**: This endpoint returns a JSON object containing an array of `summaries` and a `stats` object. The frontend should render the `summaries` array. [Source: `docs/stories/3.1.fix-user-isolation-bug.md`]
    *   **GET /api/refresh-videos**: This endpoint triggers the video refresh process on the backend. The frontend should provide user feedback during and after this process (e.g., disabling the button, showing a notification). [Source: `docs/stories/2.2.fetch-and-store-video-data.md`]

*   **File Locations**:
    *   The main logic for this story will be in `client/src/pages/Dashboard.js`. [Source: `docs/architecture/8-source-tree.md`]

*   **Testing**:
    *   Manual testing is sufficient for this MVP. Verify that the dashboard displays the correct summaries for the logged-in user and that the refresh button works as expected. [Source: `docs/architecture/11-testing-strategy.md`]

### Assessment
The implementation is excellent. It features a much-improved user experience, with clear feedback messages, better styling, and a more informative layout. The code is clean, well-structured, and meets all acceptance criteria.

### Recommendations
- No changes are required. The current implementation is excellent.
- For future consideration: As the number of summaries grows, we should consider adding pagination to the dashboard to manage performance. This can be a separate story.

### Status
This story is ready to be moved to "Done" status.
