# Story 3.1: "Save for Later" Functionality

## Status: Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** a way to save interesting summaries,
**so that** I can easily find them again later.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1.  Each summary card on the dashboard has a "Save" button.
2.  Clicking "Save" stores the video's ID and title in the browser's `localStorage`.
3.  A "Saved Items" link is available in the main navigation.
4.  The "Saved Items" page retrieves the list from `localStorage` and displays the saved video titles.
5.  The user can remove items from their saved list, which updates `localStorage`.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Add Save Button to Dashboard Summary Cards** (AC: 1)
    - [x] Modify `client/src/pages/Dashboard.js` to include a "Save" button on each video summary card.

- [x] **Task 2: Implement Save to `localStorage`** (AC: 2)
    - [x] In `client/src/pages/Dashboard.js`, implement an `onClick` handler for the "Save" button.
    - [x] This handler should store the `video_id` and `title` of the summary in `localStorage`.
    - [x] Ensure the `localStorage` key is unique per user or per application instance.

- [x] **Task 3: Add "Saved Items" Link to Navigation** (AC: 3)
    - [x] Modify `client/src/App.js` to add a navigation link to the `/saved` route.

- [x] **Task 4: Implement "Saved Items" Page** (AC: 4)
    - [x] In `client/src/pages/Saved.js`, retrieve the saved video IDs and titles from `localStorage`.
    - [x] Display the saved video titles as a list.

- [x] **Task 5: Implement Remove from Saved List** (AC: 5)
    - [x] On the `Saved.js` page, add a "Remove" button next to each saved item.
    - [x] Implement an `onClick` handler to remove the corresponding item from `localStorage`.
    - [x] Update the displayed list after removal.

## Dev Notes

*   **Architecture & Tech Stack**:
    *   **Frontend**: This story primarily involves the React frontend. Use `react` and `react-router-dom`. [Source: `docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md`]
    *   **Data Storage**: The story explicitly states using browser `localStorage` for saving items. No backend or database changes are required for this functionality. [Source: `docs/prd/epic-3-polish-user-experience.md`]

*   **File Locations**:
    *   `client/src/pages/Dashboard.js` for adding the save button.
    *   `client/src/App.js` for navigation link.
    *   `client/src/pages/Saved.js` for implementing the saved items page.

*   **Testing**:
    *   Manual testing is sufficient for this MVP. Verify that items can be saved, viewed on the saved page, and removed from the list. [Source: `docs/architecture/11-testing-strategy.md`]

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
The implementation for "Save for Later" functionality is robust and well-executed. The `Dashboard.js` component correctly handles saving and unsaving items to `localStorage`, including preventing duplicates and providing clear visual feedback. The `Saved.js` component effectively retrieves, displays, and manages the saved items, offering both individual removal and a "Clear All" option. The code adheres to React best practices and maintains a clean, readable structure.
