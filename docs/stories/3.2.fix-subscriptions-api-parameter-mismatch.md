# Story 3.2: Fix Subscriptions API Parameter Mismatch

## Problem
The `/api/subscriptions` endpoint was returning a 500 error with "Not authenticated" even though users were successfully logged in and the dashboard was working fine.

## Root Cause Analysis
**Parameter Mismatch Bug**: The `server.js` file was calling `getSubscriptions()` with only one parameter, but the function in `youtube.js` expected two parameters (accessToken AND refreshToken).

```javascript
// BROKEN (server.js line 145):
const subscriptions = await youtubeService.getSubscriptions(req.user.access_token);

// EXPECTED BY youtube.js:
async function getSubscriptions(accessToken, refreshToken) { ... }
```

This mismatch caused the YouTube API authentication to fail, even though the user session was valid.

## Solution
Updated the `/api/subscriptions` endpoint in `server.js` to pass both required parameters:

```javascript
// FIXED (server.js line 145):
const subscriptions = await youtubeService.getSubscriptions(
  req.user.access_token,
  req.user.refresh_token
);
```

## Testing
- ✅ End-to-end testing with Playwright MCP confirmed the fix works
- ✅ Channels page now loads successfully with full YouTube subscriptions list
- ✅ No more 500 errors on `/api/subscriptions` endpoint
- ✅ All authentication flows working correctly

## Impact
- **Immediate Fix**: Channels page now fully functional
- **User Experience**: Users can now select and manage their YouTube channel subscriptions
- **API Reliability**: Subscriptions endpoint now works consistently
- **No Breaking Changes**: All other functionality remains intact

## Files Modified
- `server.js` - Fixed parameter mismatch in subscriptions endpoint
- `db.js` - Restored missing database file (was accidentally deleted)

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED
