# Story 1.3: Database Setup

## Status: Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to set up the initial database schema and connect it to the backend,
**so that** the application has a persistent data layer.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A SQL script or equivalent setup in `db.js` exists that creates the `users`, `selected_channels`, and `video_summaries` tables (including the `user_id` column for user isolation) as currently implemented.
2. The Express server successfully connects to the database on startup.
3. The database connection string is managed via the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable, defaulting to a local SQLite file if not provided.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] **Task 1: Verify Database Schema** (AC: 1)
    - [x] Review `db.js` to confirm that the `CREATE TABLE` statements for `users`, `selected_channels`, and `video_summaries` match the schema in `docs/architecture.md`.
    - [x] Ensure all columns, types, and constraints are correct.

- [x] **Task 2: Verify Database Connection** (AC: 2, 3)
    - [x] Review `server.js` to ensure it requires `db.js`.
    - [x] Review `db.js` to confirm it uses `process.env.DATABASE_URL` and provides a default for local development.
    - [x] Run the server locally and confirm the "âœ… Database connected successfully" message appears in the console.

## Dev Notes
*   **Architecture & Tech Stack**:
    *   **Database**: SQLite for local, PostgreSQL for production. [Source: `docs/architecture.md#3-tech-stack`]
    *   **Database Interaction**: Use raw SQL via the `sqlite3` package. All database setup logic is centralized in `db.js`. [Source: `docs/architecture.md#3-tech-stack`]

*   **File Locations**:
    *   All database setup and helper functions are in `db.js`. [Source: `docs/architecture.md#8-source-tree`]

*   **Security**:
    *   The `DATABASE_URL` **must** be loaded from environment variables for production. [Source: `docs/architecture.md#12-security-considerations`]

*   **Testing**: 
    *   Manual verification is required. Start the server and check for connection logs. Inspect the database file to confirm tables are created. [Source: `docs/architecture.md#11-testing-strategy`]
