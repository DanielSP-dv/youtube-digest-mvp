# Story 9.3: Fix Duplicate Export in App.jsx

## Status: In Progress

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to fix the duplicate default export in `App.jsx`,
**so that** the Vite build can complete successfully.

## Problem
The Vite build is failing with a `Multiple exports with the same name "default"` error. This is a syntax error introduced during a previous refactor.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. The duplicate `export default` statement must be removed from `client/src/App.jsx`.
2. The application must build successfully on Railway.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Correct `App.jsx`** (AC: 1)
    - [ ] Read `client/src/App.jsx`.
    - [ ] Identify and remove the duplicate `export default` statement.

## Dev Notes
*   This is a simple syntax fix to resolve the final build error from the Vite migration.
