# Story 6.5: Configure Production Database Path

## Status: In Progress

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** the application to use a writable directory for its SQLite database when deployed,
**so that** the server can start without a `SQLITE_CANTOPEN` error.

## Problem
The application is crashing on Railway because it defaults to creating the SQLite database in a read-only directory. The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable, which tells the app where to create the file, has not been set in the production environment.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. The `DATABASE_URL` environment variable is documented as a mandatory requirement for production deployment.
2. When deployed with the `DATABASE_URL` variable set (e.g., to `file:/tmp/database.sqlite`), the application starts successfully without the `SQLITE_CANTOPEN` error.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Diagnose the Crash**
    - [x] Analyzed logs and identified `SQLITE_CANTOPEN` as the fatal error.
    - [x] Determined the root cause is the missing `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.

- [ ] **Task 2: Document and Communicate Fix** (AC: 1)
    - [ ] Create this story to document the required environment variable.
    - [ ] Instruct the user to set the variable in their Railway dashboard.

- [ ] **Task 3: Verify the Fix** (AC: 2)
    - [ ] Awaiting user to set the variable and redeploy.
    - [ ] The fix will be verified when the application boots successfully.

## Dev Notes
*   **CRITICAL ACTION REQUIRED**: The user must set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in the Railway project settings.
*   **Recommended Value for Demo**: `file:/tmp/database.sqlite` (This is a temporary, writable directory).
*   **For Persistence**: A Railway volume must be attached and the path set to something like `file:/data/database.sqlite`.
