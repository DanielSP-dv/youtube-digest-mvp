# Code Change and Logging

## Objective

To implement a code change and ensure proper logging is in place to monitor its behavior and aid in debugging.

## Steps

### 1. Identify Code to Change

Clearly define the specific section of code that needs modification. Understand its current functionality and dependencies.

### 2. Implement Code Change

Apply the necessary modifications to the code. Ensure the changes align with the project's coding standards and architectural guidelines.

### 3. Add Logging

Integrate appropriate logging statements to track the execution flow, variable values, and any potential errors related to the change. Use the project's established logging framework or standard console logging.

**Examples of what to log:**
*   Function entry and exit points
*   Key variable values at different stages
*   Results of critical operations (e.g., API calls, database queries)
*   Error messages and stack traces

### 4. Test the Change

Thoroughly test the implemented change to ensure it functions as expected and does not introduce any regressions. Verify that the new logging statements are producing the desired output.

### 5. Commit Changes

Commit the code changes with a clear and concise commit message that describes the purpose of the change and any relevant logging additions.

## Expected Outcome

*   The intended code modification is successfully implemented.
*   Relevant logging is in place to provide visibility into the code's behavior.
*   The change is tested and verified.
