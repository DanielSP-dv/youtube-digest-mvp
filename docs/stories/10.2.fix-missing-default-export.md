# Story 10.2: Fix Missing Default Export in api.js

## Status: In Progress

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to add a default export to `api.js`,
**so that** components using `import api from ...` do not break the Vite build.

## Problem
The Vite build is failing with an error `"default" is not exported by "src/api.js"`. This is because `api.js` was refactored to use only named exports, but some components still import it as a default.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. `client/src/api.js` must be updated to include both named exports for `get` and `post`, and a default export that is an object containing both methods.
2. The application must build successfully on Railway.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Add Default Export to `api.js`** (AC: 1)
    - [ ] Overwrite `client/src/api.js` with the corrected version that includes both named and default exports.

## Dev Notes
*   This is the final hotfix to resolve the deployment build failures.
