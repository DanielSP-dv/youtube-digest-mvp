# Story 8.5: Configure Vite Manifest Generation and Server Integration

## Status: In Progress

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** Vite to generate a build manifest and the server to use it,
**so that** the server can serve the correct, non-stale frontend assets in production.

## Problem
The server is crashing because it's trying to read `asset-manifest.json`, a file that Vite does not create by default. The Vite build is succeeding, but the server has no way to know the names of the hashed output files.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. The `client/vite.config.js` file must be configured to generate a manifest file upon build.
2. The `server.js` file must be updated to look for `manifest.json` (Vite's default name) in the `client/dist` directory.
3. The application must deploy and run successfully on Railway, serving the correct frontend assets.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Configure Vite to Generate a Manifest** (AC: 1)
    - [ ] Modify `client/vite.config.js` to add the `build: { manifest: true }` option.

- [ ] **Task 2: Update Server to Use Vite's Manifest** (AC: 2)
    - [ ] In `server.js`, change the `manifestPath` variable to point to `manifest.json` instead of `asset-manifest.json`.

## Dev Notes
*   This is the final step in the Vite migration, ensuring the server and client build process are fully synchronized.
