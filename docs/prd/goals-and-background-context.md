# **Goals and Background Context**

**Goals:**

*   Rapidly deploy a functional MVP to a public server (e.g., Railway or Render) for testing with an initial user base.
*   Strictly manage and minimize operational costs, particularly for the YouTube API and OpenAI services.
*   Validate the core value proposition with a simplified, reliable application before investing in a more complex architecture.

**Background Context:**

This document outlines a strategic pivot for the YouTube Digest project. The initial architecture (T3 Stack, Vercel, tRPC) was determined to be too complex and potentially costly for the immediate goal of a public demo. This revised PRD defines a leaner MVP with a simplified technology stack (e.g., Express, plain JavaScript, simple REST APIs) to accelerate deployment, control costs, and gather user feedback efficiently.

**Change Log:**
