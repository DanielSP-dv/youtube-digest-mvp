# **User Interface Design Goals**

**Overall UX Vision:**
The user experience will be purely functional and lightweight. The design should prioritize speed and ease of use over aesthetics. The goal is a simple interface that works reliably without adding development complexity.

**Key Interaction Paradigms:**

*   The application will be a standard multi-page application with simple navigation.
*   Interactions will be based on standard HTML forms and buttons.
*   No complex state management or real-time updates are required. A full page refresh on action is acceptable.

**Core Screens and Views:**

*   **Login Page:** A page with a single "Login with Google" button.
*   **Channels Page:** A list of the user's YouTube subscriptions with checkboxes for selection and a "Save" button.
*   **Dashboard Page:** A simple, reverse-chronological list of video summaries.
*   **Saved Page:** A list of links to saved summaries, managed via `localStorage`.

**Target Device and Platforms:**
The application will be **Web Responsive**, functional on both desktop and mobile browsers, but without complex responsive adaptations.

**Branding:**
No specific branding is required. The UI will use default browser styles or a minimal, utility-first CSS approach to ensure fast implementation.
